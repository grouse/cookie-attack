pong
====

Simple pong clone created with SDL2 and C++

The project was started as an entry point to creating a 2D game engine in C++ and OpenGL. Pong is just one of the many upcoming projects used to create and refine the engine itself, until it reaches a point where a more serious game can easily be created.

The entire project is created with a "make it work" mindset, it's not pretty, it's not meant to be pretty. The prettyness will be achieved through refactorisation between engine iterations. As such, there are many ugly shortcuts in this project, single responsibility practices are thrown out the window, and anyone with experience in coding will most likely start getting the spaghetti code sweats just by looking at the code. But! I made it work.

If you find anything useful, don't hesitate to use any or all of the code supplied in this repository, I simply ask of you to pay it forward :)
