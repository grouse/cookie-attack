Cookie Attack!
====

My take on the classical asteroids type space attack game, with cookies! 

## The Game
The player controls a spacecraft lost in an asteroid field. As if that wasn't enough trouble for one day, the ammunition supply has run completely dry! You, the commander, have no choice but to use your precious supply of cookies to destroy the asteroids in your path in order to escape.

## The Code
The game is created in C++ using SDL2 for user input and window management (sound and text library tbd) and OpenGL for rendering. The game is created as the engine enters its second iteration (after my amazing pong clone) and will start paving the ground for an entity-component system, how far I get with this plan remains to be seen.
