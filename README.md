Simple pong clone created with SDL2 and C++

The project was started as an entry point to creating a 2D game engine in C++ and OpenGL. Pong is just one of the many upcoming projects used to create and refine the engine itself, until it reaches to a point where a more seriousg ame can be easily created.
